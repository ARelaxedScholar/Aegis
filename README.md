# Simulation GAN-TE Carlo

## Overview
Simulation GAN-TE Carlo is a Rust-based project that automates the deployment of trading algorithms for cryptocurrencies. 

## Requirements
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (Rust package manager)
- Access to crypto exchange APIs (API keys required)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ARelaxedScholar/simulation-gan-te-carlo.git
   cd simulation-gan-te-carlo
2. Just have fun? Honestly the only reason this is public is because I don't have enough reach that it would matter, lel. When I get somethign good enough, this will become private in a second.
